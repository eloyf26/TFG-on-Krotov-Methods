Solving Problems with Time-dependent Hamiltonians
*************************************************


Time-Dependent Operators
========================

In the previous examples of quantum evolution,
we assumed that the systems under consideration were described by time-independent Hamiltonians.
However, many systems have explicit time dependence in either the Hamiltonian,
or the collapse operators describing coupling to the environment, and sometimes both components might depend on time.
The time-evolutions solvers such as :func:`sesolve`, :func:`brmesolve`, etc. are all capable of handling time-dependent Hamiltonians and collapse terms.
QuTiP use :class:`QobjEvo` to represent time-dependent quantum operators.
There are three different ways to build a :class:`QobjEvo`: :


1. **Function based**: Build the time dependent operator from a function returning a :class:`Qobj`:

.. code-block:: python

    def oper(t):
        return num(N) + (destroy(N) + create(N)) * np.sin(t)
    H_t = QobjEvo(oper)

1. **List based**: The time dependent quantum operator is represented as a list of ``qobj`` and ``[qobj, coefficient]`` pairs.

.. code-block:: python

    H_t = QobjEvo([num(N), [create(N), lambda t: np.sin(t)], [destroy(N), lambda t: np.sin(t)]])


3. **coefficent based**: The product of a :class:`Qobj` with a :class:`Coefficient` result in a :class:`QobjEvo`:

.. code-block:: python

    coeff = coefficent(lambda t: np.sin(t))
    H_t = num(N) + (destroy(N) + create(N)) * coeff

These 3 examples will create the same time dependent operator, however the function based method will usually be slower when used in solver.


Solvers will accept a :class:`QobjEvo`: when an operator is expected: this include the Hamiltonian ``H``, collapse operators, expectation values operators, the operator of :func:`brmesolve`'s ``a_ops``, etc.
Exception are :func:`krylovsolve`'s Hamiltonian and HEOM's Bath operators.


Most solvers will accept any format that could be made into a :class:`QobjEvo`: for the Hamiltonian.
All of the following are equivalent:


.. code-block:: python

    result = mesolve(H_t, ...)
    result = mesolve([num(N), [destroy(N) + create(N), lambda t: np.sin(t)]], ...)
    result = mesolve(oper, ...)


Collapse operator also accept a list of object that could be made into :class:`QobjEvo`:.
However one needs to be careful about not confusing the list nature of the `c_ops` parameter with list format quantum system.
In the following call:

.. code-block:: python

    result = mesolve(H_t, ..., c_ops=[num(N), [destroy(N) + create(N), lambda t: np.sin(t)]])

:func:`mesolve` will see 2 collapses operators: ``num(N)`` and ``[destroy(N) + create(N), lambda t: np.sin(t)]``.
It is therefore preferred to pass each collapse operator as either a :class:`Qobj`: or a :class:`QobjEvo`:.


As an example, we will look at a case with a time-dependent Hamiltonian of the form :math:`H=H_{0}+f(t)H_{1}` where :math:`f(t)` is the time-dependent driving strength given as :math:`f(t)=A\exp\left[-\left( t/\sigma \right)^{2}\right]`.
The following code sets up the problem

.. plot::
    :context: reset

    ustate = basis(3, 0)
    excited = basis(3, 1)
    ground = basis(3, 2)

    N = 2 # Set where to truncate Fock state for cavity
    sigma_ge = tensor(qeye(N), ground * excited.dag())  # |g><e|
    sigma_ue = tensor(qeye(N), ustate * excited.dag())  # |u><e|
    a = tensor(destroy(N), qeye(3))
    ada = tensor(num(N), qeye(3))

    c_ops = []  # Build collapse operators
    kappa = 1.5 # Cavity decay rate
    c_ops.append(np.sqrt(kappa) * a)
    gamma = 6  # Atomic decay rate
    c_ops.append(np.sqrt(5*gamma/9) * sigma_ue) # Use Rb branching ratio of 5/9 e->u
    c_ops.append(np.sqrt(4*gamma/9) * sigma_ge) # 4/9 e->g

    t = np.linspace(-15, 15, 100) # Define time vector
    psi0 = tensor(basis(N, 0), ustate) # Define initial state

    state_GG = tensor(basis(N, 1), ground) # Define states onto which to project
    sigma_GG = state_GG * state_GG.dag()
    state_UU = tensor(basis(N, 0), ustate)
    sigma_UU = state_UU * state_UU.dag()

    g = 5  # coupling strength
    H0 = -g * (sigma_ge.dag() * a + a.dag() * sigma_ge)  # time-independent term
    H1 = (sigma_ue.dag() + sigma_ue)  # time-dependent term

Given that we have a single time-dependent Hamiltonian term, and constant collapse terms, we need to specify a single Python function for the coefficient :math:`f(t)`.  In this case, one can simply do

.. plot::
    :context: close-figs
    :nofigs:

    def H1_coeff(t):
        return 9 * np.exp(-(t / 5.) ** 2)

In this case, the return value depends only on time.  However it is possible to add optional arguments to the call, see `Using arguments`_.
Having specified our coefficient function, we can now specify the Hamiltonian in list format and call the solver (in this case :func:`qutip.mesolve`)

.. plot::
    :context: close-figs

    H = [H0, [H1, H1_coeff]]
    output = mesolve(H, psi0, t, c_ops, [ada, sigma_UU, sigma_GG])

We can call the Monte Carlo solver in the exact same way (if using the default ``ntraj=500``):


..
  Hacky fix because plot has complicated conditional code execution

.. doctest::
    :skipif: True

    output = mcsolve(H, psi0, t, c_ops, [ada, sigma_UU, sigma_GG])

The output from the master equation solver is identical to that shown in the examples, the Monte Carlo however will be noticeably off, suggesting we should increase the number of trajectories for this example.
In addition, we can also consider the decay of a simple Harmonic oscillator with time-varying decay rate

.. plot::
    :context: close-figs

    kappa = 0.5

    def col_coeff(t, args):  # coefficient function
        return np.sqrt(kappa * np.exp(-t))

    N = 10  # number of basis states
    a = destroy(N)
    H = a.dag() * a  # simple HO
    psi0 = basis(N, 9)  # initial state
    c_ops = [QobjEvo([a, col_coeff])]  # time-dependent collapse term
    times = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
    output = mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops, [a.dag() * a])



Qobjevo
=======

:class:`QobjEvo` as a time dependent quantum system, as it's main functionality create a :class:`Qobj` at a time:

.. doctest:: [basics]
    :options: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    >>> print(H_t(np.pi / 2))
    Quantum object: dims=[[2], [2]], shape=(2, 2), type='oper', isherm=True
    Qobj data =
    [[0. 1.]
     [1. 1.]]


:class:`QobjEvo` shares a lot of properties with the :class:`Qobj`.

:class:`QobjEvo`'s follow the same mathematical operations rules than :class:`Qobj`.
They can be added, subtracted and multiplied with scalar, ``Qobj`` and ``QobjEvo``.
They also support the `dag` and `trans` and `conj` method and can be used for tensor operations and super operator transformation:

.. code-block:: python

    H = tensor(H_t, qeye(2))
    c_op = tensor(QobjEvo([destroy(N), lambda t: np.exp(-t)]), sigmax())

    L = -1j * (spre(H) - spost(H.dag()))
    L += spre(c_op) * spost(c_op.dag()) - 0.5 * spre(c_op.dag() * c_op) - 0.5 * spost(c_op.dag() * c_op)


Or equivalently:

.. code-block:: python

    L = liouvillian(H, [c_op])


Using arguments
---------------

Until now, the coefficient were only functions of time.
In the definition of ``H1_coeff``, the driving amplitude ``A`` and width ``sigma`` were hardcoded with their numerical values.
This is fine for problems that are specialized, or that we only want to run once.
However, in many cases, we would like study the same problem with a range of parameters and not have to worry about manually changing the values on each run.
QuTiP allows you to accomplish this using by adding extra arguments to coefficients function that make the :class:`QobjEvo`.
For instance, instead of explicitly writing 9 for the amplitude and 5 for the width of the gaussian driving term, we can add an `args` positional variable:


.. plot::
    :context: close-figs

    def H1_coeff(t, args):
        return args['A'] * np.exp(-(t/args['sigma'])**2)


or, new from v5, add the extra parameter directly:


.. plot::
    :context: close-figs

    def H1_coeff(t, A, sigma):
        return A * np.exp(-(t / sigma)**2)


When the second positional input of the coefficient function is named ``args``, the arguments are passed as a Python dictionary of ``key: value`` pairs.
Otherwise the coefficient function is called as ``coeff(t, **args)``.
In the last example, ``args = {'A': a, 'sigma': b}`` where ``a`` and ``b`` are the two parameters for the amplitude and width, respectively.
This ``args`` dictionary need to be given at creation of the :class:`QobjEvo` when function using then are included:

.. plot::
    :context: close-figs

    system = [H0, [H1, H1_coeff]]
    args={'A': 9, 'sigma': 5}
    qevo = QobjEvo(system, args=args)

But without ``args``, the :class:`QobjEvo` creation will fail:

.. plot::
    :context: close-figs

    try:
        QobjEvo(system)
    except TypeError as err:
        print(err)

When evaluation the :class:`QobjEvo` at a time, new arguments can be passed either with the ``args`` dictionary positional arguments, or with specific keywords arguments:

.. plot::
    :context: close-figs

    print(qevo(1))
    print(qevo(1, {"A": 5, "sigma": 0.2}))
    print(qevo(1, A=5))


Whether the original coefficient used the ``args`` or specific input does not matter.
It is fine to mix the different signatures.

Solver calls take an ``args`` input that is used to build the time dependent system.
If the Hamiltonian or collapse operators are already :class:`QobjEvo`, their arguments will be overwritten.

.. code-block:: python

    def system(t, A, sigma):
        return H0 + H1 * (A * np.exp(-(t / sigma)**2))

    mesolve(system, ..., args=args)


To update arguments of an existing time dependent quantum system, you can pass the previous object as the input of a :class:`QobjEvo` with new ``args``:


.. plot::
    :context: close-figs

    print(qevo(1))
    print(qevo(1, {"A": 5, "sigma": 0.2}))
    new_qevo = QobjEvo(qevo, args={"A": 5, "sigma": 0.2})
    print(new_qevo(1))


:class:`QobjEvo` created from a monolithic function can also use arguments:


.. code-block:: python

    def oper(t, w):
        return num(N) + (destroy(N) + create(N)) * np.sin(t*w)

    H_t = QobjEvo(oper, args={"w": np.pi})


When merging two or more :class:`QobjEvo`, each will keep it arguments, but calling it with updated are will affect all parts:


.. plot::
    :context: close-figs

    qevo1 = QobjEvo([[sigmap(), lambda t, a: a], [sigmam(), lambda t, a, b: a+1j*b]], args={"a": 1, "b":2})
    qevo2 = QobjEvo([[num(2), lambda t, a, c: a+1j*c]], args={"a": 2, "c":2})
    summed_evo = qevo1 + qevo2
    print(summed_evo(0))
    print(summed_evo(0, a=3, b=1))


Coefficients
============

To build time dependent quantum system we often use a list of :class:`Qobj` and *coefficient*.
These *coefficients* represent the strength of the corresponding quantum object a function that of time.
Up to now, we used functions for these, but QuTiP support multiple formats: ``callable``, ``strings``, ``array``.


**Function coefficients** :
Use a callable with the signature ``f(t: double, ...) -> double`` as coefficient.
Any function or method that can be called by ``f(t, args)``, ``f(t, **args)`` is accepted.


.. code-block:: python

    def coeff(t, A, sigma):
        return A * np.exp(-(t / sigma)**2)

    H = QobjEvo([H0, [H1, coeff]], args=args)


**String coefficients** :
Use a string containing a simple Python expression.
The variable ``t``, common mathematical functions such as ``sin`` or ``exp`` an variable in args will be available.
If available, the string will be compiled using cython, fixing variable type when possible, allowing slightly faster excution than function.
While the speed up is usually very small, in long evolution, numerous calls to the functions are made and it's can accumulate.
From version 5, compilation of the coefficient is done only once and saved between sessions.
When Cython is not available, the code will be executed in python with the same environment.
This, however, as no advantage over using python function.


.. code-block:: python

    coeff = "A * exp(-(t / sigma)**2)"

    H = QobjEvo([H0, [H1, coeff]], args=args)


Here is a list of defined variables:
    ``sin``, ``cos``, ``tan``, ``asin``, ``acos``, ``atan``, ``pi``,
    ``sinh``, ``cosh``, ``tanh``, ``asinh``, ``acosh``, ``atanh``,
    ``exp``, ``log``, ``log10``, ``erf``, ``zerf``, ``sqrt``,
    ``real``, ``imag``, ``conj``, ``abs``, ``norm``, ``arg``, ``proj``,
    ``np`` (numpy) and ``spe`` (scipy.special).


**Array coefficients** :
Use the spline interpolation of an array.
Useful when the coefficient is hard to define as a function or obtained from experimental data.
The times at which the array are defined must be passed as ``tlist``:

.. code-block:: python

    times = np.linspace(-sigma*5, sigma*5, 500)
    coeff = A * exp(-(times / sigma)**2)

    H = QobjEvo([H0, [H1, coeff]], tlist=times)


Per default, a cubic spline interpolation is used, but the order of the interpolation can be controlled with the order input:
Outside the interpolation range, the first or last value are used.

.. plot::
    :context: close-figs

    times = np.array([0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0])
    coeff = times * (1.1 - times)
    tlist = np.linspace(-0.1, 1.1, 25)

    H = QobjEvo([qeye(1), coeff], tlist=times)
    plt.plot(tlist, [H(t).norm() for t in tlist], label="CubicSpline")

    H = QobjEvo([qeye(1), coeff], tlist=times, order=0)
    plt.plot(tlist, [H(t).norm() for t in tlist], label="step")

    H = QobjEvo([qeye(1), coeff], tlist=times, order=1)
    plt.plot(tlist, [H(t).norm() for t in tlist], label="linear")

    plt.legend()


When using array coefficients in solver, if the time dependent quantum system is in list format, the solver tlist is used as times of the array.
This is often not ideal as the interpolation is usually less precise close the extremities of the range.
It is therefore better to create the QobjEvo using an extended range prior to the solver:


.. plot::
    :context: close-figs

    N = 5
    times = np.linspace(-0.1, 1.1, 13)
    coeff = np.exp(-times)

    c_ops = [QobjEvo([destroy(N), coeff], tlist=times)]
    plt.plot(
        mesolve(qeye(N), basis(N, N-1), np.linspace(0, 1, 11), c_ops=c_ops, e_ops=[num(N)]).expect
    )


Different coefficient types can be mixed in a :class:`QobjEvo`.


Given the multiple choices of input style, the first question that arises is which option to choose?
In short, the function based method (first option) is the most general,
allowing for essentially arbitrary coefficients expressed via user defined functions.
However, by automatically compiling your system into C++ code,
the second option (string based) tends to be more efficient and run faster.
Of course, for small system sizes and evolution times, the difference will be minor.
Lastly the spline method is usually as fast the string method, but it cannot be modified once created.


.. _time-dynargs:

Accessing the state from solver
===============================

In QuTiP 4.4 to 4.7, it was possible to request that the solver pass the state, expectation values or collapse operators via arguments to :class:`QobjEvo`. Support for this is not yet available in QuTiP 5.
