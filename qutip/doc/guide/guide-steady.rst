Introduction
============

For time-independent open quantum systems with decay rates larger than the corresponding excitation rates, the system will tend toward a steady state as :math:`t\rightarrow\infty` that satisfies the equation

.. math::
    \frac{d\hat{\rho}_{ss}}{dt}=\mathcal{L}\hat{\rho}_{ss}=0.

Although the requirement for time-independence seems quite resitrictive, one can often employ a transformation to the interaction picture that yields a time-independent Hamiltonian.  For many these systems, solving for the asymptotic density matrix :math:`\hat{\rho}_{ss}` can be achieved using direct or iterative solution methods faster than using master equation or Monte Carlo simulations.  Although the steady state equation has a simple mathematical form, the properties of the Liouvillian operator are such that the solutions to this equation are anything but straightforward to find.

Steady State solvers in QuTiP
=============================

In QuTiP, the steady-state solution for a system Hamiltonian or Liouvillian is given by :func:`qutip.steadystate.steadystate`.  This function implements a number of different methods for finding the steady state, each with their own pros and cons, where the method used can be chosen using the ``method`` keyword argument.

   * - Method
     - Keyword
     - Description
   * - Direct (default)
     - 'direct'
     - Direct solution solving :math:`Ax=b`.
   * - Eigenvalue
     - 'eigen'
     - Iteratively find the zero eigenvalue of :math:`\mathcal{L}`.
   * - Inverse-Power
     - 'power'
     - Solve using the inverse-power method.
   * - SVD
     - 'svd'
     - Steady-state solution via the **dense** SVD of the Liouvillian.


The function :func:`qutip.steadystate` can take either a Hamiltonian and a list
of collapse operators as input, generating internally the corresponding
Liouvillian super operator in Lindblad form, or alternatively, a Liouvillian
passed by the user.

Both the ``"direct"`` and ``"power"`` method need to solve a linear equation
system. To do so, there are multiple solvers available: ``

QuTiP can take advantage of the Intel Pardiso LU solver in the Intel Math
Kernel library that comes with the Anacoda (2.5+) and Intel Python
distributions.  This gives a substantial increase in performance compared with
the standard SuperLU method used by SciPy.  To verify that QuTiP can find the
necessary libraries, one can check for ``INTEL MKL Ext: True`` in the QuTiP
about box (:func:`qutip.about`).


.. _steady-usage:

Using the Steadystate Solver
=============================

Solving for the steady state solution to the Lindblad master equation for a
general system with :func:`qutip.steadystate` can be accomplished
using::

>>> rho_ss = steadystate(H, c_ops)

where ``H`` is a quantum object representing the system Hamiltonian, and
``c_ops`` is a list of quantum objects for the system collapse operators. The
output, labelled as ``rho_ss``, is the steady-state solution for the systems.
If no other keywords are passed to the solver, the default 'direct' method is
used with ``numpy.linalg.solve``, generating a solution that is exact to
machine precision at the expense of a large memory requirement. However
Liouvillians are often quite sparse and using a sparse solver may be preferred:


.. code-block:: python

   rho_ss = steadystate(H, c_ops, method="power", solver="spsolve")

where ``method='power'`` indicates that we are using the inverse-power solution
method, and ``solver="spsolve"`` indicate to use the sparse solver.


Sparse solvers may still use quite a large amount of memory when they factorize the
matrix since the Liouvillian usually has a large bandwidth.
To address this, :func:`qutip.steadystate` allows one to use the bandwidth minimization algorithms
listed in :ref:`steady-args`. For example:

.. code-block:: python

   rho_ss = steadystate(H, c_ops, solver="spsolve", use_rcm=True)

where ``use_rcm=True`` turns on a bandwidth minimization routine.

Although it is not obvious, the ``'direct'``, ``'eigen'``, and ``'power'``
methods all use an LU decomposition internally and thus can have a large
memory overhead.  In contrast, iterative solvers such as the ``'gmres'``,
``'lgmres'``, and ``'bicgstab'`` do not factor the matrix and thus take less
memory than the LU methods and allow, in principle, for extremely
large system sizes. The downside is that these methods can take much longer
than the direct method as the condition number of the Liouvillian matrix is
large, indicating that these iterative methods require a large number of
iterations for convergence.  To overcome this, one can use a preconditioner
:math:`M` that solves for an approximate inverse for the (modified)
Liouvillian, thus better conditioning the problem, leading to faster
convergence.  The use of a preconditioner can actually make these iterative
methods faster than the other solution methods. The problem with precondioning
is that it is only well defined for Hermitian matrices.  Since the Liouvillian
is non-Hermitian, the ability to find a good preconditioner is not guaranteed.
And moreover, if a preconditioner is found, it is not guaranteed to have a good
condition number. QuTiP can make use of an incomplete LU preconditioner when
using the iterative ``'gmres'``, ``'lgmres'``, and ``'bicgstab'`` solvers by
setting ``use_precond=True``. The preconditioner optionally makes use of a
combination of symmetric and anti-symmetric matrix permutations that attempt to
improve the preconditioning process.  These features are discussed in the
:ref:`steady-args` section.  Even with these state-of-the-art permutations,
the generation of a successful preconditoner for non-symmetric matrices is
currently a trial-and-error process due to the lack of mathematical work done
in this area.  It is always recommended to begin with the direct solver with no
additional arguments before selecting a different method.

Finding the steady-state solution is not limited to the Lindblad form of the
master equation. Any time-independent Liouvillian constructed from a
Hamiltonian and collapse operators can be used as an input::

>>> rho_ss = steadystate(L)

where ``L`` is the Louvillian.  All of the additional arguments can also be
used in this case.

.. _steady-example:

Example: Harmonic Oscillator in Thermal Bath
============================================

A simple example of a system that reaches a steady state is a harmonic oscillator coupled to a thermal environment.  Below we consider a harmonic oscillator, initially in the :math:`\left|10\right>` number state, and weakly coupled to a thermal environment characterized by an average particle expectation value of :math:`\left<n\right>=2`.  We calculate the evolution via master equation and Monte Carlo methods, and see that they converge to the steady-state solution.  Here we choose to perform only a few Monte Carlo trajectories so we can distinguish this evolution from the master-equation solution.
